## How FindATradie Works

### For Businesses
1. List Your Business: Set up a public business page by following the steps below, allowing clients to browse your profile.
2. A Client Reaches Out: A client finds your business, checks your reviews, and submits a job request, which is sent to you.
3. Send a Quote: Review the job request and provide a quote for the cost. The quote is sent to the client for them to accept or decline.

### For Clients
1. Tell Us What You Need: Choose the type of tradie needed for the job or view all tradies on the app.
2. View Tradies: Browse the list of qualified tradies who suit the job you need done.
3. Send a Job Request: Provide information to the tradie about the job you need done.

## Job Requests Management for Businesses
1. Pending: This section contains client job requests. Decide whether to send a quote or decline the job.
2. Quote Sent: After sending a quote, the job moves to this section. Update the job status once the client accepts or declines the quote.
3. In Progress: When a quote is accepted, the job moves to this section, indicating it is underway.
4. Canceled: This section displays the jobs declined by you or the client.
